My interests in life vary but for the sake of this audience, I'm a passionate nerd. I fell in love with the hacking and cyber security world 14 years ago and this is where I apply my focus.

As a curiously optomisitc problem solver I believe in taking nontraditional approaches to fix the problems of tomorrow. Once fixed, create a process then rinse and repeat.

I've shared my passion at the goverment, nonprofit, startup and Fortune 100 level. I'm on a constant mission of growth pertaining to security management programs in the areas of incident response, threat hunting, cloud security, security analytics, security architecture and malware analysis.

I strongly believe that the future of #infosec is what we each contribute which is why I mentor and volunteer my time to empower others. Currently helping startups 10x with wicked security programs, speaking about security from conference stages and learning about artificial intelligence. Happy Hunting.
