## What is SkiCon?

SkiCon is where apr√®s ski and infosec meet!  
We aim to join the outdoors and winter sports with cybersecurity research. We differ from most security conferences and hacker gatherings we want you to be outside, active, healthy, and feel the sunshine on your skin.

## Where do I go skiing/riding?

[Wachusett Mountain](https://www.wachusett.com/) is our ski resort this year. Something we've learned from previous years is "we strongly implore if you need ski/snowboarding lessons, please take them before joining the larger group on the mountain". Your saftey is #1 in this world. We don't want to see you injured as well, winter sports require a bit of skill so make sure you're comfortable in your own skin. 

## Where do I sleep and attend talks?

All talks will be held at [Colonial Hotel](https://www.colonial-hotel.com/), this is also where we have a room block.
